Status
------

Zinc is currently in a maintenance mode. There's no active development of new features.
New releases are meant to stay up-to-date with latest sbt releases. Zinc tries to follow
final releases of sbt. It doesn't follow milestone releases but exceptions can be
introduced on a case-by-case basis.

Maintenance of zinc is performed on a best-effort terms. We try our best to not lag
behind sbt with zinc releases but we do not guarantee it. Occasional delays can
happen due to other priorities.

If you are interested in helping with zinc maintenance or development, please contact
Adriaan Moors (@adriaanm) at Typesafe.

Build
-----

Zinc is built using sbt 0.13. To create the full distribution:

    sbt universal:packageZipTarball

Previously published distributions up to 0.3.1-M1 relase can be found in the [old zinc repo].
Newer distributions are hosted under [Typesafe downloads].

[old zinc repo]: http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/zinc/com/typesafe/zinc/dist/
[Typesafe downloads]: http://downloads.typesafe.com/zinc/

Here's the table of final releases in 0.3.x series:

Options
-------

To get information about options run `zinc -help`.

### Compile

As for `scalac` the main options for compiling are `-classpath` for specifying
the classpath elements, and `-d` for selecting the output directory. Anything
passed on the command-line that is not an option is considered to be a source
file.

### Scala

Zinc needs to locate the Scala compiler jar, Scala library jar, and any extra
Scala jars (like Scala reflect). There are three alternative ways to specify the
Scala jars.

Using `-scala-home` point to the base directory of a Scala distribution (which
needs to contain a `lib` directory with the Scala jars).

Using `-scala-path` the compiler, library, and any extra jars (like scala
reflect) can be listed directly as a path.

Using `-scala-library` to directly specify the Scala library, `-scala-compiler`
to specify the Scala compiler, and `-scala-extra` to specify any extra Scala
jars.

If no options are passed to locate a version of Scala then Scala 2.9.2 is used
by default (which is bundled with zinc).

To pass options to scalac simply prefix with `-S`. For example, deprecation
warnings can be enabled with `-S-deprecation`. For multi-part options add the
`-S` prefix to all parts. For example, the sourcepath option can be specified
with `-S-sourcepath -S/the/source/path`.

### Java

To select a different `javac` to compile Java sources, use the `-java-home`
option. To pass options to javac, prefix with `-C`.

If mixed Java and Scala sources are being compiled then the compile order can be
specified with `-compile-order`, where the available orders are `Mixed`,
`JavaThenScala`, or `ScalaThenJava`. The default order is `Mixed`.

If only Java sources are being compiled then the `-java-only` option can be
added to avoid the Scala library jar being automatically added to the classpath.

### Nailed

Zinc comes with built-in [Nailgun] integration. Running with Nailgun provides
zinc as a server, communicating commands via a client, keeping cached compilers
in a warm running JVM and avoiding startup and load times.

To run zinc as a build daemon add the `-nailed` option to all commands, or
`alias zinc="zinc -nailed"`.

Nailgun client binaries for common platforms are bundled with zinc. If an `ng`
client is on the current path then this will be used instead.

To shutdown the zinc server run `zinc -shutdown`. To list currently cached zinc
compilers use `zinc -status`.

### Logging

The log level can be set directly with `-log-level debug|info|warn|error`. Or to
set to debug use `-debug`. To silence all logging use `-quiet`.

### Analysis

The analysis used to determine which files to incrementally recompile is stored
in a file. The default location for the analysis cache is relative to the output
directory. To specify a different location for the analysis cache use the
`-analysis-cache` option. When compiling multiple projects, and the analysis
cache is not at the default location, then a mapping from output directory to
cache file for any upstreams projects should also be provided with the
`-analysis-map` option.

### Incremental Compiler

There are options for configuring the incremental compiler. One useful option is
`-transactional`, which will restore the previous class files on compilation
failure. This allows fixes to be made before retrying incremental compilation,
rather than forcing recompilation of larger parts of the source tree due to the
error and deleted class files.

See `zinc -help` for information about all options.
